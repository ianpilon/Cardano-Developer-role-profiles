# Governance/DAO Developer

A **Governance/DAO Developer** is a backend developer specializing in creating tools and systems for decentralized governance on the Cardano blockchain, such as those supporting Project Catalyst or delegated representative (dRep) voting systems. The role focuses on enhancing community-driven decision-making, a core pillar of Cardano’s ecosystem.

## Overview

Governance/DAO Developers build tools to facilitate decentralized governance, such as voting dashboards, proposal systems, or treasury management solutions, exemplified by a developer creating a dashboard to analyze dRep voting rationales. Cardano’s Project Catalyst, with over $100 million in funding rounds, and its dRep system create a niche for developers focused on governance solutions, requiring expertise in Cardano’s unique governance model and smart contract development.

## Technical Stack

- **Plutus**: Haskell-based platform for writing governance-related smart contracts.
- **Haskell**: Core programming language for Plutus-based development.
- **Cardano CLI**: Command-line interface for interacting with the Cardano blockchain.
- **APIs for Catalyst integration**: Tools for connecting governance systems to Project Catalyst.

## Responsibilities

### Daily Tasks

- Developing smart contracts for voting or proposal systems using Plutus or Aiken.
- Building frontend interfaces for DAO interactions.
- Testing governance mechanisms for fairness and security.
- Documenting governance processes for community use.
- Engaging with the community to gather feedback on governance tools.

### Milestones

- Deploying a new version of a DAO’s governance framework.
- Implementing significant new governance features, such as on-chain treasury management or new voting mechanisms.
- Completing a user testing phase for new governance tools.

### Long-Term Goals

- Developing and helping implement a widely adopted governance model or toolkit for DAOs on Cardano.
- Significantly contributing to the evolution of Project Catalyst or Cardano’s on-chain governance.
- Fostering a thriving ecosystem of DAOs.

## Motivations and Rewards

Governance/DAO Developers are driven by a strong belief in decentralized governance, satisfaction from enabling collective decision-making, and interest in the social and political aspects of blockchain technology. Rewards for this role include:

- Funding from treasuries, such as Project Catalyst.
- Payment for developing governance tools.
- Recognition for contributing to Cardano’s governance framework.
- Potential for influence within the ecosystem.
- Job offers due to demand for governance expertise.

## Challenges

The role presents several challenges, including:

- Ensuring high voter participation in governance systems.
- Preventing malicious proposals or vote manipulation.
- Complexity of on-chain treasury management.
- Creating user-friendly interfaces for complex governance actions.
- Navigating legal ambiguity surrounding DAOs.

## Learning and Development Process

### Getting Started

Developers begin by learning about Project Catalyst and Cardano’s dRep system, researching on-chain governance principles and DAO tooling from other blockchains. They explore Plutus/Aiken for voting and treasury management contracts and engage with Cardano community discussions on decentralized decision-making. Resources include:

- **Project Catalyst website** and **Cardano Forum** (Governance section).
- **IOG Blog** for governance updates.
- **Twitter** (Cardano governance experts, dReps).
- Academic papers and blogs on DAO governance (e.g., Aragon, DAOstack).

They set up a Plutus/Aiken development environment, acquire testnet ADA, configure a wallet for testing governance interactions, explore existing DAO frameworks or example Plutus contracts, and set up a basic frontend for testing.

### Development Workflow

The development process includes:

- Developing Plutus/Aiken smart contracts for voting, proposal submission, and treasury management.
- Building frontend interfaces for DAO members to interact with contracts.
- Testing governance mechanisms for fairness and security on testnets.
- Deploying tools and onboarding community members.

### Advanced Development

Experienced developers focus on:

- Refining governance smart contracts for efficiency or new features, such as quadratic voting or liquid democracy elements.
- Improving user interfaces for DAO participation.
- Developing analytics tools for governance activity.
- Contributing to evolving Cardano governance standards.

## Resources and Community

Governance/DAO Developers rely on resources such as:

- **Project Catalyst website** for governance model details.
- **Cardano Forum** (Governance section) for community discussions.
- **IOG Blog** for updates on governance.
- **Twitter** (Cardano governance experts, dReps) for insights.
- Academic papers and blogs on DAO governance for broader principles.

They engage with key figures in Project Catalyst, influential dReps, researchers in decentralized governance, leaders of established DAOs, and active community members for guidance and feedback.

## Impact and Significance

Governance/DAO Developers enhance decentralized decision-making on Cardano by building tools that increase community participation and ensure fair governance processes. Their work strengthens Cardano’s community-driven ecosystem and supports initiatives like Project Catalyst.

**Core Task**: Develop governance tools.

**Steps**:

- Analyze Project Catalyst requirements.
- Code dashboards or voting logic.
- Test for fairness and security.
- Deploy governance tools.

**Metrics of Success**: Voter turnout and tool adoption.

**Obstacles**: Complex governance logic and ensuring user engagement.

## Professional and Social Dynamics

Governance/DAO Developers are respected for enabling decentralized governance, enhancing their status in community-driven ecosystems. Successful tools strengthen their reputation as governance experts, while low voter turnout may reduce impact. They interact with governance and community sectors to build tools, engage voters for feedback, and align with Project Catalyst for funding.

Developers feel a sense of purpose in enabling governance, frustration with low engagement, and fulfillment from high community participation. They fear low voter turnout undermining their tools and are driven by empowering community voice.

## Values and Approach

Governance/DAO Developers value transparency and community engagement, defining success by voter participation and tool adoption. They avoid centralized designs and believe collaboration is key. Their community-driven culture shapes a participatory approach. They are motivated by empowering community voice, prioritizing long-term decentralization, and seeking recognition for governance impact.

## Decision-Making and Problem-Solving

Governance/DAO Developers rely on data (e.g., voting metrics) and community intuition, analyzing thoroughly to ensure fairness. They seek community input for alignment, balance risks with participation goals, and consider community emotions. Their methodical approach ensures transparent logic, breaking down problems for clarity and sticking to well-thought-out plans while remaining comfortable with governance ambiguity.

# Infrastructure Developer

An **Infrastructure Developer** is a core protocol or infrastructure engineer specializing in maintaining and optimizing Cardano’s core protocol, nodes, or consensus mechanisms, such as Ouroboros Praos. The role focuses on improving the scalability and reliability of the Cardano network, which supports approximately 250 transactions per second (TPS).

## Overview

Infrastructure Developers contribute to critical components like Cardano’s node software or scaling solutions such as Hydra. The role requires a deep understanding of Cardano’s research-driven architecture and its Ouroboros consensus mechanism, distinguishing it from other blockchain ecosystems. This position may overlap with DevOps due to its focus on network performance and deployment.

## Technical Stack

- **Haskell**: The primary programming language for Cardano’s core protocol and node software.
- **Cardano Node**: The software running Cardano’s blockchain network.
- **Cardano DB Sync**: A tool for syncing blockchain data to a database for analysis and querying.

## Responsibilities

### Daily Tasks

- Monitoring network performance and diagnosing node issues.
- Debugging and patching Cardano node software.
- Testing new protocol features on development networks (devnets).
- Writing scripts for deployment and maintenance.
- Contributing to core Cardano codebases, such as cardano-node.
- Performing performance optimization tasks to enhance scalability.

### Milestones

- Contributing to a major release of the Cardano node software.
- Implementing and testing a significant network parameter update.
- Developing new tooling for network monitoring or analysis.
- Completing a research spike on a new consensus or scaling feature.

### Long-Term Goals

- Leading the development of a key component of Cardano’s core infrastructure.
- Making significant contributions to Cardano’s scalability, security, or sustainability, such as through Ouroboros enhancements or new scaling solutions.
- Mentoring other core protocol developers.

## Motivations and Rewards

Infrastructure Developers are driven by deep technical curiosity about blockchain fundamentals, the challenge of working on foundational network technology, and satisfaction from building highly performant, scalable, and reliable systems. Rewards for this role include:

- Salaries or contracts from organizations like Input Output Global (IOG) or the Cardano Foundation.
- Grants for protocol improvements.
- Recognition as a core contributor to Cardano.
- Prestigious career opportunities in blockchain infrastructure.

## Challenges

The role presents several challenges, including:

- Extreme complexity of core protocols like Ouroboros.
- Ensuring backward compatibility and network stability during upgrades.
- Long development and testing cycles for protocol changes.
- Coordinating changes across a decentralized network of stakeholders.
- Diagnosing rare or hard-to-reproduce bugs.

## Learning and Development Process

### Getting Started

Developers often come from systems programming, distributed systems, or academic research backgrounds. They discover Cardano through its scientific papers on Ouroboros and ledger design, dive into the cardano-node source code, and explore IOG’s research blog and engineering updates. They:

- Install Haskell and Nix for development.
- Clone the cardano-node repository and set up the build environment.
- Learn to compile and run a local Cardano node.
- Connect to testnets and explore node CLI commands and configuration options.
- Set up monitoring tools like Grafana for their local node.

### Development Workflow

The development process includes:

- Modifying or contributing to the cardano-node Haskell codebase for features or bug fixes.
- Writing extensive tests for protocol changes.
- Participating in peer reviews.
- Deploying changes to internal and public testnets.
- Monitoring network impact and collaborating with research teams.

### Advanced Development

Experienced developers focus on:

- Performance tuning of the node for memory, CPU, and network efficiency.
- Improving consensus algorithm efficiency or security.
- Developing new tools for network analysis or debugging.
- Contributing to research on future protocol upgrades, such as advanced scaling solutions or new cryptographic primitives.

## Resources and Community

Infrastructure Developers rely on resources such as:

- **IOG Research website** for Ouroboros and ledger design papers.
- **IOG Blog** for engineering updates.
- **GitHub** (cardano-node, cardano-ledger repositories) for code and contribution guidelines.
- **Cardano technical documentation** for protocol details.
- **Haskell language resources** for programming expertise.
- Academic conference proceedings (e.g., IACR) for cryptography insights.
- **Twitter** (core IOG engineers and researchers) for updates.

They engage with senior IOG engineers and researchers (e.g., Aggelos Kiayias, Duncan Coutts), core contributors to cardano-node/ledger, respected Haskell developers, and academic collaborators on Cardano research papers.

## Impact and Significance

Infrastructure Developers ensure the scalability and reliability of Cardano’s core protocol, directly improving TPS and network stability for users and dApps. Their work underpins the entire Cardano ecosystem, supporting its growth and performance.

**Core Task**: Optimize Cardano’s core infrastructure.

**Steps**:

- Analyze performance metrics.
- Code updates to the node software.
- Test changes on devnets and testnets.
- Deploy upgrades to the network.

**Metrics of Success**: TPS, node uptime, and latency.

**Obstacles**: Deep protocol knowledge and complexity of testing upgrades.

## Professional and Social Dynamics

Infrastructure Developers are highly regarded for maintaining Cardano’s core, elevating their status among technical peers. Successful contributions enhance network reliability, while outages risk criticism. They interact with protocol and dApp sectors to ensure stability, engage node operators for feedback, and collaborate with IOG for protocol updates.

Developers feel pride in optimizing infrastructure, stress from protocol complexity, and confidence from achieving high TPS and stability. They fear network outages impacting users and are driven by ensuring network stability.

## Values and Approach

Infrastructure Developers value reliability and efficiency, defining success by uptime and TPS. They avoid untested changes and believe persistence is key. Their research-driven culture shapes a rigorous approach. They are motivated by network stability, prioritize long-term scalability, and seek recognition for infrastructure reliability.

## Decision-Making and Problem-Solving

Infrastructure Developers rely heavily on data, such as performance metrics, and analyze extensively before acting. They prefer independent problem-solving for focus, weigh risks heavily to prioritize stability, and remain objective while emotions guide rigor. Their methodical approach ensures reliability, breaking down problems into components and sticking to well-thought-out plans with low comfort for ambiguity.
